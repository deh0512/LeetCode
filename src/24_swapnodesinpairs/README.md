# Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/

# Explanation

A single traversal through the list and a bunch of pointer swapping is all that's required to solve this problem. There is likely a way to use less pointer variables than I have in my solution, but a little extra space in exchange for clarity doesn't hurt.
