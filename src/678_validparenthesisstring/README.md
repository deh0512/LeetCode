# Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/

# Explanation

This problem is quite complex given the Medium rating, I felt. The parsing parentheses problem intuitively involves a stack to check for open and closing pairs. The addition of the wildcard character muddles the algorithm. A more comprehensive search algorithm might be more straightforward to implement, but the efficiency would degrade considerably. As far as I can tell, this linear algorithm is optimal in terms of time complexity, evidenced by the "faster than 100%" result at the time of submission.
