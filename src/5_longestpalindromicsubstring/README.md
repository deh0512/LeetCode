# Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

# Explanation

The solution presented here is a brute force solution. In a palindrome, the center shifts and may be a single character or two characters depending whether the palindrome is of an odd or even length, respectively.

I suspect there is likely a dynamic programming solution that is more efficient.
