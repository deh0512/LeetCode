# Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/

# Explanation

This one is not so different from [problem 39](../39_combinationsum). If the candidates are sorted and you don't start from a value previously seen in the candidate list and you exclude re-using the current value, you get the desired solution.

I will say that I think this problem is formulated strangely. It could use a better description of the desired solution set.
