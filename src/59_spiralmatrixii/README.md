# Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/

# Explanation

This felt really familiar since I had done [Spiral Matrix](../54_spiralmatrix) not so long ago. I decided to do it in Python, but there's no surprises or tricks to the algorithm. Just move the indices carefully around the matrix and set the correct values.
